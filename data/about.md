  content: "Overmorrow Brewing’s story begins in 2008, when **Chris Jarvis** and **Gray Sutherland**, two friends met while studying at university in Pittsburgh. The two bonded over their shared love of contemporary classical music, a growing interest in craft beer, and a nascent wanderlust. After several years in Seattle and other cities around the world pursuing projects together and separate (including performing with flugabone and resonator guitar as folk-punk duo Elephant Gazebo) the two split up – Chris to settle in and pursue his love of the Vietnamese language, and Gray to develop his remote business while continuing to travel. Nonetheless, the two made a point of running into each other in various cities on three continents and enjoying whatever tasty food and drink their host countries had to offer.\n\n\rIn 2015, the pair realized that two of Chris’s great passions – Vietnam and homebrewing – could come together and forge a place in the then-fledgling Hanoi craft beer scene. After years of developing his web consulting business, Gray was ready for a new challenge, his wanderings ended, and he joined Chris in Vietnam to begin working on their new project. Joined by **Nam Tran** and **Noah Tanabe**, two other travelers with roots in Vietnam, Japan, and America, our founders form a team that pairs global experiences with love for everything Vietnam has to offer.\r\n\nOur beers have taken similarly long journeys across the oceans and the years: They come from the moors of old Scotland, the mountains of traditional French mining country, and the forests and hop fields of modern West Coast America. Here, they have combined with ingredients from Vietnam’s cane fields, rice paddies, and mountain slopes. Just as we’ve gained from our travels, we like to think that these traditional styles gained something special as they made their way over here. Together, we’ve all found a home in Vietnam."

  intro: >-
    **Inspired by our namesake, an old word to talk about the future, here at
    Overmorrow Brewing we craft beers to promote and honor classic styles
    throughout history – while updating them for the present and the future here
    in Vietnam.**


    Just like our founding team, our beers are a mix of well-traveled styles
    from around the world with local Vietnamese flavors and ingredients. We are
    experimental but never compromise on quality and never launch anything that
    we are not happy to drink ourselves.
