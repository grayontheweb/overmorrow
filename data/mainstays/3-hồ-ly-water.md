introduction: A Crisp Brut IPA Brewed With Northern Vietnamese Rice
description: "The modern arms race of bearded and bespectacled American brewers seeking a crisp canvas to showcase brash IPAs has led to new frontiers in brewing. A bold innovation has come from a California brewer who discovered a new use for an old brewing enzyme to create a style the world had never seen–the **Brut IPA**.\r\n\n**Hồ Ly Water** is a truly modern beer, using hops imported from four countries and a backbone of local Bắc Hương rice to fuel the enzymes that create a uniquely dry IPA."
