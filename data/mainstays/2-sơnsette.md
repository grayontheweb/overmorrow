introduction: A Savory and Rustic Belgian-style Grisette Ale with Vietnamese Mountain Spices
description: "At sunup, 19th-century French miners would descend deep into the mountain, looking forward only to a rustic beer served by gray-clad women at the end of their sunless shift: **“Grisette”.** We’ve revived this nearly lost style, a thirst-quenching ale to be enjoyed as the crimson sunset washes over a hard day’s labor.\r\n\n**Sơnsette** is the marriage of handpicked spices from mountainous Northern Vietnam, international hops, and French farmhouse ale yeast to create a savory yet thirst-quenching beer."
