Introduction: An Easy-Drinking Scottish Ale with Caramelized Local Sugarcane
description: "Over 200 years ago, the term **“Scotch Ale”** was first used to describe the full-bodied ales placed onto ships in Edinburgh harbour and sent to every corner of the globe. With every sip of malt and sweetness, weary expatriates were reminded of the crash of the waves against the rocks along the Scottish coast.\n\n\r**Leann on Mía** is a classic 80-shilling “Export” Ale with local caramelized sugarcane to bring out natural toffee flavors. Low in alcohol content but high in crisp and refreshing flavor."
