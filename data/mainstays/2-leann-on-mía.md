    A Savory and Rustic Belgian-style Grisette Ale with Vietnamese Mountain
    Spices
  long: >-
    At sunup, 19th-century French miners would descend deep into the mountain,
    looking forward only to a rustic beer served by gray-clad women at the end
    of their sunless shift: **“Grisette”**. We’ve revived this nearly lost
    style, a thirst-quenching ale to be enjoyed as the crimson sunset washes
    over a hard day’s labor.


    **Sơnsette** is the marriage of handpicked spices from mountainous Northern
    Vietnam, international hops, and French farmhouse ale yeast to create a
    savory yet thirst-quenching beer.
